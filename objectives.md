# Goal

Make this repo's training behavior match ../trm_quest exactly for sudoku puzzles, while keeping the codebase simpler and more elegant.
I want to however stick to the following : 
context size : 1 instead of 16
only sudoku puzzle. I dont care about other puzzles. 
Simplified readable code. 

# Context

- Original repo: ../trm_quest - full implementation with multiple puzzle types
- Current repo: ./ - simplified version for sudoku only
- Known issues documented in issues.md (check them yourself though, they may be incomplete or incorrect)
